# Sol-Hmn

## What is this ?

    Sol-Hmn is a fun project that I'm working on to gain some knowledge on reverse engineering and game hacking.
	And I worked on reversing a 2D shooter game called "Soldat" to improve myself on reverse engineering.


## A little reminder...


	Before diving into the code you need to know that this project is only for 'Soldat 1.7.1'.
	Memory addresses, structures, functions can differ version to version.
	Even a small change on the game's source code may cause this project to not to work.
